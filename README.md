# Install Required Packages

Make sure to install the following Python packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install flask numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow

# Host the Model:
Host the saved model using a server, such as TensorFlow Serving, which allows you to expose your model through an API. Alternatively, you can use cloud services like Google Cloud AI Platform, AWS Sagemaker, or TensorFlow Serving on Google Cloud Functions.
